1.1 Project Objectives 
Your project objectives are generally clear and relevant. 
However, there are several areas where improvement is needed to strengthen clarity and alignment with FYP 
expectations. 
Some objectives are descriptive rather than measurable. You should revise the objectives so that each one clearly 
indicates what will be designed, implemented, or evaluated by the end of the project. For example, consider 
stating how success will be measured, such as system accuracy, functionality completion, or user evaluation. 
The objectives list includes many system features, but they are not clearly distinguished between core objectives 
and supporting features. You are encouraged to prioritise the main objectives that directly address the problem 
of lack of personalisation, and treat features such as wishlist or ratings as supporting elements. 
The AI-related objective should be more specific in scope. You should clarify whether the AI recommendation 
focuses on rule-based logic, machine learning, or a hybrid approach, and ensure that this scope remains 
realistic for an FYP timeline. 
1.2 Project Background 
The background section is well written and supported by statistics, but it can be improved further in the following 
ways: 
The problem statement is implied rather than explicitly stated. You should clearly summarise the core problem in 
one focused paragraph, for example, the difficulty users face in selecting suitable clothing due to lack of body 
and style based personalisation. 
While industry statistics are provided, the link between these statistics and your proposed solution can be 
strengthened. You should explicitly explain how high cart abandonment or return rates justify the need for an 
AI-based recommendation system. 
The background currently discusses many issues together. You are advised to narrow the focus towards the most 
critical problem that your system aims to solve, rather than covering too many general e-commerce challenges. 
1.3 Advantages and Contributions 
This section is structured well, but improvements are needed to meet rubric expectations for contribution and 
impact. 
1.3.1 Advantages for Consumers 
The advantages listed are reasonable, but they are mostly general benefits. You should strengthen this section by 
explaining how your system specifically delivers these advantages, for example, how body measurements 
directly reduce sizing mismatch. 
Consider adding a short explanation of who the target users are, such as young adults, frequent online shoppers, 
or fashion-conscious users, to make the benefits more concrete. 
1.3.2 Contributions to the Industry 
The contribution to industry is stated, but it would benefit from clear justification of practicality. You should briefly 
explain whether such a system could realistically be adopted by fashion retailers, especially small or medium 
businesses. 
You are encouraged to relate the contribution to current industry trends, such as AI-driven personalisation, 
data-driven retail, or mobile commerce growth. 
1.3.3 Contributions to Research 
The research contribution is relevant, but it can be improved by being more specific. You should clearly state what 
aspect of recommendation systems your project contributes to, for example, the combination of physical 
attributes and cultural style preferences. 
Consider briefly explaining how this approach differs from existing studies discussed later in the Literature Review, 
to strengthen the academic value of the project. 
1.5 Project Team and Organization 
This section is clear but can be strengthened slightly. 
Since this is an individual project, you should briefly emphasise your personal responsibility and independent role 
in planning, development, and decision making, rather than focusing mainly on structure. 
1.6 Chapter Summary and Evaluation 
The summary is adequate, but improvements are recommended. 
The evaluation part is mostly descriptive. You should strengthen it by briefly reflecting on why the proposed solution is 
suitable and feasible, rather than restating earlier content. 
Consider linking this chapter more clearly to the next chapter by explaining why a literature review is necessary to 
support your proposed approach. 
2.1 Introduction 
The introduction explains what the chapter covers, but it can be improved by clearly stating the purpose of the 
literature review in relation to your project. You should explicitly mention that this chapter helps to justify the problem, 
support the proposed AI solution, and guide your design decisions. 
You are encouraged to briefly outline how the chapter is organised, for example by explaining that it first reviews 
fashion recommendation systems, followed by AI techniques, and then related commercial systems. 
2.2 Related Studies on Fashion Recommendation Systems 
The studies cited are relevant, but the discussion is mostly descriptive. You should strengthen this section by 
comparing the studies, not just describing them one by one. For example, explain how one study improves on another, 
or why certain approaches are more suitable for fashion applications. 
You mention that few systems combine body measurements with stylistic preferences. This is an important point, but 
it should be clearly linked to your project gap. You should explicitly state that this limitation directly motivates your 
proposed system. 
Consider adding one or two more recent or well known studies to show broader coverage of the domain, especially 
studies that focus on mobile fashion applications or real world deployment. 
2.3 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Fashion 
This section introduces AI techniques appropriately, but the connection to your chosen approach needs to be clearer. 
You should explain why certain techniques such as CNNs or hybrid models are mentioned even if they are not fully 
implemented in your project. 
When you state that a pre trained model will be used, you should justify this decision more clearly, for example in terms 
of time constraints, dataset availability, or computational resources. 
The table comparing algorithms is useful, but you should refer to the table explicitly in your text and explain how it 
supports your design choice. 
2.4 E-Commerce Application Features and Design 
The discussion of existing e-commerce features is relevant, but it remains high level. You should explain how these 
features influence your own system design decisions, such as UI simplicity, mobile first design, or feature prioritisation. 
When citing user engagement statistics, you should clearly link them to your proposed features, such as AI 
recommendations, ratings, or feedback mechanisms. 
You are advised to briefly discuss user trust and usability, as these are important factors when introducing AI based 
recommendations. 
2.5 Related Systems Comparison 
The comparison table is clear, but the analysis after the table is too brief. You should explain more clearly why existing 
systems fail to meet user needs and how your system addresses these weaknesses. 
Some limitations listed are general. You should make them more specific, for example by explaining exactly what type 
of personalisation is missing in existing apps. 
You are encouraged to justify why the proposed system is realistic and feasible, not just more advanced. 
2.6 Summary and Evaluation 
The summary restates earlier points but lacks critical evaluation. You should briefly explain how the reviewed studies 
influenced your final design decisions, such as the choice of a hybrid recommendation model. 
Consider clearly restating the research and technical gap that your project addresses, and how this gap supports the 
feasibility of your proposed solution. 
You may also include a short transition statement explaining how this literature review informs the methodology and 
system design in the next chapter. 
2.7 Reference 
The references used are relevant, but the number of sources is limited. You should consider adding more academic 
and technical sources to demonstrate stronger research depth. 
Ensure that all in text citations match the reference list exactly and that the formatting follows the latest APA style 
consistently. 
3.1 Introduction 
The introduction explains what the chapter contains, but it can be improved by clearly stating why this methodology is 
suitable for your specific project. You should briefly explain how this chapter ensures that the proposed solution is 
feasible and well planned. 
Consider adding a short sentence to link this chapter with Chapter 2, explaining that the methodology and 
requirements are derived from the gaps and decisions identified in the literature review. 
3.2.1 Selected Development Model: Agile Development 
The choice of Agile is appropriate, but the explanation is too general. You should clearly explain how Agile will be 
applied in your project, not just what Agile is. 
You are advised to explain how many iterations or sprints are expected, what happens in each sprint 
The methodology description should clearly distinguish what will be completed in Project 1 such as analysis and 
design, and what will be implemented in Project 2. 
3.2.2 Advantages of Agile for This Project 
The advantages listed are relevant, but they are generic. You should strengthen this section by directly linking each 
advantage to your project, for example how Agile supports AI model refinement or UI improvement. 
You may also explain how Agile helps to manage risk and uncertainty, especially when dealing with AI components and 
data availability. 
3.4.1 Use Case Diagram 
The identified actors are reasonable, but you should justify the inclusion of the Admin actor, especially if the admin 
module is optional or limited in scope. 
The use cases listed are clear, but you should ensure that all use cases are within the scope of Project 2 
implementation, and clearly mark any that are future enhancements. 
You are encouraged to explain how the use case diagram supports system completeness, rather than only listing the 
functions. 
3.4.2 Data Flow Diagram (DFD) – Level 0 
The process description is understandable, but it would benefit from clearer explanation of data inputs and outputs 
. 
You should explicitly mention what data is stored, where it is stored, and how it flows back to the user. 
Consider briefly explaining why Level 0 DFD is sufficient at this stage and whether deeper levels will be developed later. 
3.5.1 Functional Requirements 
The functional requirements are mostly clear, but some are too broad. You should revise them so that each 
requirement describes one clear system function. 
Ensure that all functional requirements are testable, meaning it should be possible to verify whether each requirement 
is met. 
You should also check for overlap between requirements, especially between browsing, recommendation, and ordering 
functions. 
3.5.2 Non-Functional Requirements 
The non functional requirements are relevant, but they need stronger justification. For example, you should explain why 
a response time of three seconds is acceptable for this application. 
Some requirements such as reliability and scalability are high level. You are encouraged to relate them to realistic FYP 
constraints, such as prototype scale or limited user base. 
3.6 Chapter Summary and Evaluation 
The summary restates earlier content but lacks critical reflection. You should briefly explain why this methodology 
and requirement set increases the feasibility of the project. 
Consider adding a short statement on potential risks, such as limited AI training data or integration challenges, and 
how the methodology helps manage them 
You may also strengthen the transition by explaining how this chapter directly informs the system design in 
Chapter 4. 
4.1.1 System Workflow Steps 
The workflow description is detailed and easy to follow. However, it is very long and procedural, which makes it 
read more like a user manual than a design explanation. You should condense repetitive steps and focus on 
key system interactions that demonstrate design logic. 
Some steps describe obvious actions, such as opening the app or clicking buttons. You may shorten these parts 
and instead emphasise decision points, such as when AI 
recommendations are triggered or when data is written to the database. 
You should briefly explain why the workflow is designed in this order, for example why AI recommendation is 
optional and how it integrates with normal browsing. 
4.1.2 Workflow Diagram (Description) 
The explanation of the workflow diagram is clear, but it should be more analytical. You should explain how the 
diagram helps validate system completeness and user flow consistency 
. 
Consider explicitly stating what the diagram proves, such as showing that both AI assisted and manual browsing 
paths lead to the same checkout process 
You may also mention any assumptions or limitations of the workflow at this stage, such as simulated payment or 
limited tracking functionality 
4.2.1 UI Wireframe Description 
The UI descriptions are clear, but they are mostly descriptive. You should explain design decisions, such as why certain 
features are placed on the Home Screen or why AI recommendations are easily accessible. 
You are encouraged to link UI elements to usability principles, such as reducing cognitive load, improving navigation 
efficiency, or supporting mobile first design. 
It would strengthen this section if you clarify whether the wireframes are low fidelity or high fidelity, and whether they 
are final or subject to iteration in Project 2. 
4.3.1 Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) 
The ERD is comprehensive, but you should include a short paragraph explaining how the ERD supports system 
requirements, not just listing entities and attributes. 
Some entities, such as Payment and Delivery, are well defined, but you should clarify that they are simulated at this 
stage to avoid confusion about real world payment integration. 
You should briefly justify key relationships, for example why Order and Order_Details are separated, or why 
AIRecommendation is stored as a separate entity. 
4.3.2 Class Diagram 
The class diagram aligns well with the ERD, but you should explicitly explain how the classes map to system modules, 
such as UI layer, backend logic, or AI component 
. 
Some methods are listed but not explained. You should briefly describe what each major method does, especially for 
AIRecommendation and Order related classes. 
Ensure consistency between class attributes and database fields, and explain any intentional differences. 
4.3.3 Database Schema 
The schema is detailed, but the explanation focuses heavily on structure rather than design reasoning. You should 
explain why this schema supports scalability, data integrity, or maintainability. 
You should also mention data normalisation considerations, especially where multiple tables are used to reduce 
redundancy. 
Clarify how sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, is protected, even in a simulated 
environment. 
4.4.1 Layers 
The layered architecture is appropriate, but the explanation can be strengthened by explicitly linking each layer to 
functional requirements. 
You should clarify the boundary between frontend and backend responsibilities, especially for AI processing and 
authentication. 
Consider briefly discussing why a layered architecture was chosen over other architectures, such as monolithic or 
microservices. 
4.4.2 Architecture Diagram 
If an architecture diagram is included, ensure it is clearly labelled and referenced in the text. 
You should explain how data flows between components in the diagram, rather than only describing each component 
in isolation. 
Mention any assumptions, such as internet connectivity or cloud availability. 
4.5.1 Login Validation Process 
The login process is clear, but it would benefit from a short explanation of error handling, such as invalid credentials or 
network failure. 
You should also explain why Firebase Authentication was chosen, linking it to security, reliability, or development 
efficiency. 
4.5.2 AI Recommendation Process 
This is a strong section, but it needs clear justification of design choices. You should explain why height, weight, and 
style were selected as primary inputs. 
Consider briefly discussing limitations, such as accuracy dependency on dataset size or simplified body modelling. 
You may also explain how this process supports future improvement, such as adding learning from user feedback. 
4.5.3 Simulated Payment Process 
You should clearly state that this is a simulated process and explain why real payment integration is out of scope for 
FYP. 
Explain how simulation still supports end to end system validation, even without real transactions. 
4.6 Algorithm / Model Design 
The algorithm design is detailed, You should clarify which parts are conceptual design and which parts will be fully 
implemented in Project 2. 
You should justify parameter choices, such as weights and layer sizes, at a conceptual level, even if they are not final. 
Consider explaining how this model design remains feasible within FYP constraints. 
4.7 Security Design 
The security measures are well listed, but they would benefit from stronger linkage to identified risks, such as data 
leakage or unauthorised access. 
You should clarify which security features are handled by third party services and which are implemented by your own 
system. 
Consider briefly explaining how security will be tested or validated in Project 2. 
4.8 Chapter Summary and Evaluation 
The summary is clear but mostly descriptive. You should add a short evaluation explaining why the design is suitable, 
scalable, and feasible. 
You may also reflect briefly on design trade offs, such as using a lightweight AI model instead of deep learning. 
Strengthen the transition by clearly stating how this design will guide system implementation and testing in the next 
chapter. 
GENERAL FORMATTING, LANGUAGE, AND ACADEMIC WRITING FEEDBACK 
1. Formatting and Structural Consistency 
There are inconsistencies in heading capitalisation and numbering across chapters. You should ensure that all chapter 
titles, section headings, and subheadings follow a single consistent format throughout the report. 
Some sections contain excessive spacing and blank pages, particularly before and after chapter breaks. These should 
be reviewed and reduced to maintain a clean and professional academic layout. 
Tables and figures are included, but some are not clearly labelled or referenced in the surrounding text. Every table and 
f
igure should have a proper caption and must be explicitly referred to in the explanation. 
Ensure consistent formatting for tables, including font size, alignment, and border style, so that they appear uniform 
across all chapters. --------------------------------------- 
2. Consistency of Terminology 
Certain technical terms are used inconsistently, for example “AI recommendation engine”, “AI model”, and 
“recommendation system”. You should select one primary term and use it consistently throughout the report. 
The naming of entities, classes, and database tables should be consistent across ERD, class diagrams, database 
schema, and text explanation. Any differences should be intentional and clearly explained. 
Abbreviations such as AI, UI, ERD, and DFD should be defined at first occurrence and then used consistently without 
switching between full terms and abbreviations. --------------------------------------- 
3. Language Use and Clarity 
The overall language quality is good, but some sentences are too long and complex, which may reduce clarity. You 
should revise such sentences into shorter and more direct statements. 
Avoid repeating the same idea across multiple sentences within the same paragraph. Each paragraph should focus on 
one clear point. 
Ensure that explanations focus on what and why, not only what the system does. This will improve academic clarity 
and depth. --------------------------------------- 
4. Academic Tone and Writing Style 
The report generally maintains a formal tone, but some sections sound overly descriptive, similar to promotional or 
user guide content. You should revise these parts to be more analytical and objective. 
Avoid informal expressions and conversational phrasing. All explanations should be written in a neutral, academic 
style. 
When evaluating your own system, avoid making strong claims without justification. Statements should be supported 
by design reasoning, literature, or clear assumptions. --------------------------------------- 
5. Use of First Person View 
The report currently uses first person expressions such as “this project presents” or implied personal ownership. You 
should minimise first person usage and adopt a third person or passive academic style. 
For example, instead of focusing on what “the project does”, focus on what “the proposed system is designed to 
achieve”. 
Maintain this writing style consistently across all chapters, including abstract, methodology, and system design. --------------------------------------- 
6. Tense Consistency 
There are inconsistencies in the use of future tense and present tense, especially when describing system features and 
processes. 
Use present tense when describing system design and capabilities. 
Use future tense only when referring to planned work in Project 2. --------------------------------------- 
7. Citation and Referencing Style 
Ensure that all citations follow the latest APA format consistently, including in-text citations and reference list entries. 
Some references are mentioned generally but not cited at specific points in the text. You should ensure that every 
referenced idea is properly cited. 
Check that all references listed are actually cited in the text, and remove any unused references. --------------------------------------- 
8. Overall Writing Improvement Advice 
Before final submission, you are strongly advised to proofread the entire report in one complete pass, focusing only on 
consistency and tone. 
Reading the report as a whol
